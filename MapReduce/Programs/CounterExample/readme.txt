This MapReduce program demonstrates how counters can be used to track the progress of any MapReduce job.
Within the program, there is a counter for each vowel; A, E, I, O, and U. Every time a key is processed 
which begins with one of these letters, a counter is incremented. These counters can be tracked in the 
terminal while the job is running, and a screen-shot of these counters during the run has been provided 
in the 'output' directory.
