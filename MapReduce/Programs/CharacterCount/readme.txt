This directory contains a sample MapReduce program, CharacterCount, 
which is my take on the traditional 'Word-Count' example that is used
by many introductory Hadoop/MapReduce tutorials. 

This program counts the number of individual characters by breaking 
each key down into a single character key within the mapper.
